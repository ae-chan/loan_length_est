# Ticket Statuses

[Status Descriptions](ADSK%20Guide%201f5ed9af0e874ea181f96927f1445163/Status%20Descriptions%207f538b88fc714aea9f3c2b8b9a0561b7.csv)

# Incoming Ticket Routes

1. GDA Whispers: Acknowledge within 2mins.
    - For quick answers, reply within the whisper. 5-10mins max.
    - If more time for research is required, switch to Action Needed.
    - If irrelevant, bounce back to GDA and explain why it is not for the team.
        - May use fn/PWHO and fn/XDM to find direct teams to re-bucket to.
2. Auto-Routed from Back-End: Accept within 30s and acknowledge within 30s. Introduce yourself.
3. Direct Handover: Accept within 30s. No introduction required.

# Client Types

- Terminal Users: Use fn/IB to message.
- Data Licensees (DL): Use fn/MSG.

# Identifying Tickers

Use fn/SECF for keyword search.

- If the ticker does not show on command line, it's a custom basket.
- If fn/FLDS_ID059 indicates that it's an Equity Index (EI), then workflow is likely on EQIX. If no tasks are found through EQIX, then:
    - S&P tickers might be updated via fn/FUPC93.
    - MSCI tickers might be updated via fn/ILOG.
- If fn/FLDS_ID069 indicates that it's a Newsroom Index (NI), then use fn/NRNM and find the right time to re-bucket towards (likely Eco Stats).
- For other ones, re-bucket to GDA.

# Index Properties

Most properties can be found via fn/EQIX, fn/USEI1 and fn/IXNF.

## fn/USEI1 > 8

- Number of constituents
- Index currency
- Market cap
- Divisor
- Price

## fn/IXNF

- HMOV provides a time range for available membership data
- is_disable_divisor flags whether the divisor is disabled or not

# Identifying Similar Indices

SECF > Category := Index/Stats > Eqty tab > Search by Security or Description field.

# Transparency

Subtle differences may occur between indices of the same name, price and return.

- Check fn/HP (EOD) and fn/QR (real-time) for pricing transparency differences.
- Check fn/MEMB for membership transparency differences.

# Price Confirmation

Identify the ticker's pricing source, fetch source file and provide confirmation.

## Updating HP Page

fn/PHX > PHF tab > Submit changes

fn/PHX > History View tab to view machines that are out-of-sync

## Updating Quote Line Price

fn/TMMX > Date := 'DB Day' > Enter integer N for business day T-N > Edit LAST_PRICE value for *both* Realtime and Delayed columns > Submit.

## Real-Time

(ExByte, ObjectID) form a key pair that manages real-time pricing privileges.

Check for real-time subscription details via fn/EXC.

Confirm with fn/QR (and fn/ZP) to verify that the ticker is intended to be priced real-time.

If so, find the relevant team that manages the feed, i.e. either the EBM (exchange) or Contributions team.

## Certain S&P Tickers

1. fn/FUPC93 > Records > View Records > Search Field ID := 'OBJ1', Field Value := ObjectID > Enter.
2. Double-click on the record.
3. Search for row corresponding to Field ID := 'SERI' and copy the Database Value.
4. Enter [S&P's FTP server](https://www.notion.so/antchan/Login-Credentials-a21293ebb8db4d279511177061cbf080#06f207e7a83f4442a0e125a8033a0db6) > Message Name := Database Value from above, select "/inbox" > Go!
5. Download the file for the price check date and view in XL.

## Custom Baskets

An index is a custom basket if it is both provided by a bank and does not autofill on command line.

If it's a client, direct them towards the index provider. We do not control the updating of these.

If it's a provider (bank), it depends on their pipeline.

- SMSG: Ask for the time in which the file was sent and confirm receipt of the message.
- FTP: Updated via fn/ILOG > custom basket provider > raw file.

## Missing Prices

To identify the correct pipeline, ask the provider for the frequency in which the ticker is updated:

- 10mins ⇒ EQIX (e.g. JPM, UBS, Citi rely on tasks to update their prices), typically has "10min" or "Basket" in EQIX Task Name
- 30mins ⇒ ILOG (e.g. MSCI), /IXMM/baskets contain reports by provider and their custom baskets being updated through ILOG

## Price Backfilling

Drop a file with BBG Ticker, Date and Price fields under your pricing task's naming convention.

## fn/HP Price - FX Conversions

Default FX conversions are done with the London-based settlement prices (CMPL). Other FX rates like Bloomberg-calculated (BGN), New York-based (CMPN) and Tokyo-based (CMPT) are also available.

## HP Tick Deletion

fn/PHX > HMEN tab > Upload Data > Enter changes, untick "Upload to QA" > Submit.

## Real-Time Tick Deletion

Most commonly occur for custom basket indices. In practice, use fn/TDEL to delete them. Proper checks need to be made first:

- Exchange tickers: Verify with EBM (exchange) team.
- Third party: Verify with Contributions team to check for the parser.

fn/TDEL > Enter Day and Time Range, select all Tk Types > Preview to identify spiked price ticks > Delete > Untick "Skip Offline Mode", tick all TP Machines to delete.

## TRA Mismatch

fn/TRA might not match the index provider's data due to:

- Dividends on the Terminal are calculated by BBG back-end, leading to discrepancies depending on the set of FX rates that are being used; and
- The timing of dividend inclusion differs by country.

# Membership

Use fn/CHNG to view changes in constituents over a given period

## Index Providers

Index providers manage privileges:

- For index provider (firm): Run fn/FLDS_IN082.
- For contact points: fn/FILE/References/Index Provider Contact Points.xlsx

Specific index owners found via: fn/FPVT_5_... > 8 (select ones that are online if possible).

## Privileging

The EID and NFPV bits are 1-1 mappings that manage membership privileges.

[EID-NFPV Bit Reference](ADSK%20Guide%201f5ed9af0e874ea181f96927f1445163/EID%20NFPV%20Bit%20Reference%2070ae40a7d67e4ee4b37a46f0afaddf84.md)

To view mappings: Search from fn/EID or fn/FPVT_5_...

To view index EID: fn/FLDS > Mnemonic := FEED_EID4

To view client permissions: fn/IXPM

- To change client's privileges:
    - For custom baskets: EID is set by providers themselves. Supply them with the "Custom Basket Cheat Sheet" manual.
    - For others: Search target NFPV bit on fn/EID (denoted "Terminal Bit") and update on fn/EQIX > Update Mode > Input ticker > Update NFPV-bit.
- To create: fn/FPVT > Add New FPV Product
    - FPT Type := 'Index Membership'
    - Client := Client
    - Product Name := Desired EID Name
    - Ticket Type := 'SDSK'
    - Admin UUID := Client UUID
    - Internal Owner := My UUID

## Membership Weights

Advise custom basket providers to submit the correct files instead.

If you want to adjust it for them manually, use fn/EQIX > MEMB Maintenance to update the weights for members over a pre-specified amount of time.

# Trading Hours

Assuming this could not be modified via EQIX, use fn/EXOB.

fn/EXOB > Edit Exbyte tab > Lookup trading hours for the given ExByte > Edit Object tab > Lookup trading hours for the given ExByte and ObjectID > Check if the index has been added to a different trading hours setting than what was intended for the ExByte.

fn/PHX shows the index's ExByte and ObjectID

- If there is a trading hours record for the given ObjectID, modify the trading hours (NYT) and update the object.
- Otherwise: Add Object tab > Input ExByte, ObjectID, trading hours (NYT) and Add Object.

# Spike Check

The Index NX team is responsible for index FA/EE data.

To verify a spike, first [rerun the FA calculations](https://www.notion.so/antchan/ADSK-Guide-1f5ed9af0e874ea181f96927f1445163#22b3ef5952f342cd8eceda20a283d882).

1. fn/BRD_BBTYPE_LIST > Find relevant BBType by looking up Index ID, Equity ID or Description.
2. fn/EQNX > Index tab > Load values for given dates of the spike > DT tab > Enter BBType into Field input, select relevant dates and update > Submit parameters and export to Excel.
3. Allocate offending constituent > Raise DRQS to FA/EE team to verify accuracy of the datapoint.

If the spike still exists after correction, use fn/EQNX > NXIO rule to simulate dampening of the spike:

1. fn/EQNX > Index > Ensure Ticker and Fields parameters are correct.
2. Spike Rules := OVERWRITE|1,*member ticker*|I|*index ticker*|*bbtype*|*YYYYMMDD spike start date or NA*|*YYYYMMDD spike end dat*e or NA|0 (e.g. OVERWRITE|1,3436 JT|I|NKY|922|20170531|NA|0).
3. Update.
4. Contact NX team to apply said NXIO rule.

# Historical FA Data

## Missing FA Data

There are two possibilities for missing FA data:

1. Index membership not onboarded, so there is no constituent data to build upon.
2. Lack of security-level data. This occurs when [Coverage Factor](https://www.notion.so/antchan/Index-Overview-9ecff190da804f3f8a9cb6b5dfecf48d#f73e4f124ada43339b7c97ce26aefaa1) < 0.5 threshold.

## Recalculating FA Data

fn/EIQC > Reruns tab > Select index, specify the date range > Run.

Rerun Job Status tracks update statuses.

# Different FA Values

When pulled at different times, these may change because the index-level data gets updated every time that of a constituent gets populated/revised, too. Indices get updated at different times depending on their region setting.

# Foreign Language Translation

Prepare responses in English.

- Bucket 133: Live translation
- Bucket 126: Else

# Miscellaneous

- Country ISO codes are listed in fn/ECST > Country Codes. Update a country's ISO via EQIX.
    - For ISO := MULT, the code is 'M1-36'.
- There is no official membership data on any Hang Seng indices. The data currently displayed on the Terminal reflects a manual update with rebalances done four times a year.
